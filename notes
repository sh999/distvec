Socket notes

Socket needs to be created with default values (PF_INET, etc.)  No address is associated until send/recv

create client_socket
get server_ip
sendto(client_socket,server_ip)


Sample run:
Let's say A has neighbors B (IP:10.10.1.1), D (IP:10.10.2.2) of cost 3, 5

A's Configuration file namd config_A, essentially a neighbor table:
A
A's port (90210)
B 3 10.10.1.1
D 5 10.10.2.2

Program run:
./clientserver config_A

config_A function:


sendto: sock,echostring,echostringlen,echoservaddr

sock: ntohing
echoservaddr:servip,servport


A Neighbor table (parsed config file):
B
D
Tells A where to send, here B and D

Routing table:  tells graph structure from A's pov
Initially:
Dest   Distance   NextHop
B		3  			B
D 		5 			D

Final routing table:
Dest   Distance	  NextHop
B  ...
C
D
E
F

Between the initial and final, A periodically sends and gets distance vectors
; e.g. B may send a distance vec to A with:
B
3
E  2
F  1
This says, "This is from B. I'm 2 away from you, and I'm 2 away from E, 1 away from F. Update your  routing table for E and F by adding their dists with my dist to you"
So A will have an updated routing table:
Dest   Distance   NextHop
B		3  			B
D 		5 			D
E       5			B 			 
F 		3			B
